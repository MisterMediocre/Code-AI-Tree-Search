The statement laid emphasis on the constraint that the elements are pairwise distinct. How is this important?

In fact, this implies that if the resulting sequence is increasing, then swapping any two of its elements will result in another sequence which is not increasing.

And we're able to perform a swap on any resulting sequence if and only if k ≥ 2. Thus if k ≥ 2, the answer would always be "Yes". For cases where k = 1, we replace the only zero in sequence a with the only element in b, and check the whole sequence. Hackable solutions include those only checking the replaced element and its neighbours, and those missing the replaced element.
