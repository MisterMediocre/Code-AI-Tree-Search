  "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nUnlucky year in Berland is such a year that its number n can be represented as n = x^{a} + y^{b}, where a and b are non-negative integer numbers. \n\nFor example, if x = 2 and y = 3 then the years 4 and 17 are unlucky (4 = 2^0 + 3^1, 17 = 2^3 + 3^2 = 2^4 + 3^0) and year 18 isn't unlucky as there is no such representation for it.\n\nSuch interval of years that there are no unlucky years in it is called The Golden Age.\n\nYou should write a program which will find maximum length of The Golden Age which starts no earlier than the year l and ends no later than the year r. If all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then the answer is 0.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four integer numbers x, y, l and r (2 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^18, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^18).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum length of The Golden Age within the interval [l, r].\n\nIf all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then print 0.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3 1 10\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3 5 10 22\n\nOutput\n8\n\nInput\n2 3 3 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the unlucky years are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10. So maximum length of The Golden Age is achived in the intervals [1, 1], [6, 6] and [8, 8].\n\nIn the second example the longest Golden Age is the interval [15, 22].\n\nInstructions:\n\n\nYou are a Python3 code generator.  Output **only** valid Python code. No explanations, no commentary, no filenames, no Markdown formatting. You will spit out a code block that can be pasted into any script. It must read the input, execute the logic and then print the output. Ensure that you invoke the main() or solve() function at the end if you're writing your code inside them.\nANSWER:\n",
