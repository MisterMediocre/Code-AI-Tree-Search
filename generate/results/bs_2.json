Your task is to find how long will residents of Berland wait till the next lucky year.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9) \u2014 current year in Berland.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput amount of years from the current year to the next lucky one.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n201\n\nOutput\n99\n\nInput\n4000\n\nOutput\n1000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example next lucky year is 5.
