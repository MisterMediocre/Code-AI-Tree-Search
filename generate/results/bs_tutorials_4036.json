  "prompt": "\nQUESTION:\nPolycarp has to solve exactly $n$ problems to improve his programming skill before an important programming competition. But this competition will be held very soon, most precisely, it will start in $k$ days. It means that Polycarp has exactly $k$ days for training!\n\nPolycarp doesn't want to procrastinate, so he wants to solve at least one problem during each of $k$ days. He also doesn't want to overwork, so if he solves $x$ problems during some day, he should solve no more than $2x$ problems during the next day. And, at last, he wants to improve his skill, so if he solves $x$ problems during some day, he should solve at least $x+1$ problem during the next day.\n\nMore formally: let $[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k]$ be the array of numbers of problems solved by Polycarp. The $i$-th element of this array is the number of problems Polycarp solves during the $i$-th day of his training. Then the following conditions must be satisfied:   sum of all $a_i$ for $i$ from $1$ to $k$ should be $n$;  $a_i$ should be greater than zero for each $i$ from $1$ to $k$;  the condition $a_i < a_{i + 1} \\le 2 a_i$ should be satisfied for each $i$ from $1$ to $k-1$. \n\nYour problem is to find any array $a$ of length $k$ satisfying the conditions above or say that it is impossible to do it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^9, 1 \\le k \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of problems Polycarp wants to solve and the number of days Polycarp wants to train.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf it is impossible to find any array $a$ of length $k$ satisfying Polycarp's rules of training, print \"NO\" in the first line.\n\nOtherwise print \"YES\" in the first line, then print $k$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$ in the second line, where $a_i$ should be the number of problems Polycarp should solve during the $i$-th day. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n26 6\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 2 4 5 6 8 \n\nInput\n8 3\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nInput\n1 1\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 \n\nInput\n9 4\n\nOutput\nNO\n\nTUTORIAL:\nI suppose there are some solutions without cases handling, but I'll describe my own, it handling approximately 5 cases.\n\nFirstly, let nn = n - k(k+1)/2. If nn < 0 then the answer is \"NO\" already. Otherwise let's construct the array a, where all a_i are \u2308nn / k\u2309 (except rightmost nn % k values, they are \u2308nn / k\u2309). It is easy to see that the sum of this array is nn, it is sorted in non-decreasing order and the difference between the maximum and the minimum elements is not greater than 1. Let's add 1 to a_1, 2 to a_2 and so on (this is what we subtract from n at the beginning of the solution). Then if nn \u2260 k - 1 or k = 1 then this answer is correct. Otherwise we got some array of kind 1, 3, ..., a_k. How do we fix that? For k = 2 or k = 3 there is no answer for this case (you can try to prove it or try to find answers for cases n = 4, k = 2 and n = 8, k = 3). Otherwise k > 3 and we can subtract one from a_2 and add it to a_k and this answer will be correct (this also can be proved with some easy formulas).\n\nTime complexity: O(k)\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\nYou are a Python3 code generator.  Output **only** valid Python code. No explanations, no commentary, no filenames, no Markdown formatting. You will spit out a code block that can be pasted into any script. It must read the input, execute the logic and then print the output. Ensure that you invoke the main() or solve() function at the end if you're writing your code inside them.\nANSWER:\n",
